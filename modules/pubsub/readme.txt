This module will manage publish-subscribe services of the social network. This includes creation, modification and deletion of posts and comments. Also it will manage broadcasting or multicasting of the published data. It will maintain the nodes to which data will be published and subscribed. It will categorize these nodes accordingly. Note that this module will not handle real time polling or other such related notification systems, which must be implemented elsewhere.
