			<b>Welcome to Frisby!</b>
          </p>
          <p>
			Frisby is a Social Networking API Framework. With Frisby, you can create your social applications
			wit ease. Frisby manages the entire data model of your social application. So you do not need to
			worry about the underlying complications in building your social app. You can create any sort of
			social application with Frisby, from a simple microblogger to a full blown social networking website
			with complete social features. What more? Frisby is extensible. So you can add your own variations
			to the engine.
          </p>
          <p>
			Frisby is distributed under the GNU General Public License. Thus it is open source software and
			hence free! However, being free originally, it cannot be commercialized by anyone. Thus if you
			received Frisby for free, you have to keep it free. Yet, you can hack up your own version of
			Frisby by modifying the source code for Frisby. If you are a passionate developer, have fun!
			Also, I would be really glad if you could help in the improvement of Frisby and contribute to
			the Frisby project. Thanks in advance!
          </p>
          <p>
			Before starting off with developing a social app with Frisby, please read the PHP documentation
			in order to know the capabilities of this engine. If you have any queries, feel free to mail me
			at <a href="mailto:das.rajdeep97@gmail.com">das.rajdeep97@gmail.com</a>. For the time being, Cheers!
